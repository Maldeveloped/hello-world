# hello-world
My first GitHub project (noob-coder at work)
I needed a change of career after a long-term illness left me unable to continue teaching. I can sit with a laptop and it seemed to me that I should be able to do something with that.
I wrote a few website pages for a couple of things at university, all in html, using "The WebPage Cookbook". I didn't read it all but tried to apply what I could. From what I recall that was largely text, a few pictures and some hyperlinks. That's all I've got and it was twenty years ago.
I came across a Hackernon article via Medium which caught my eye. hackernoon.com/learn-to-code-in-2018-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way-b338247eed6a It's by Andrei Neagoie suggesting I could "Learn to code in 2018, get hired, and have fun along the way". I hope that's accurate. I'm starting my official countdown from the beginning of February so I've snuck in a couple of days early to get a head start.
